# Pawnd-Password-check
Check to see how many times your password has been used.

This program takes in a string of input and uses the API at pwnedpasswords.com to check how many times your password has been pawned, or used and compromised. It hashes your password and then uses a bit of that hash, so that your password remains completely secure and is not revealed to the internet. There are a couple of other security tools I added to make it that much safer to use. This program is written in Python 3.7.
