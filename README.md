# Pawnd-Password-check
Check to see how many times your password has been used.

This app takes in a string of input and checks on an API how many times your password has been pawned. It uses a bit of a hash of the password so that your password remains secure and is not revealed to the internet. You will have to sign up for the API and add your own keys for this app to work. This app is written in Python 3.7.
